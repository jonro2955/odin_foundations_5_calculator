This is the 5th project from The Odin Project's Foundations curriculum.

Additional functionalities include the calculation history and the notepad features.  

Focus Areas:
- DOM envent handling
- Creating objects
- Accessing object properties
- Using multiple object operators
- Using powerful array functions
- Floating point handling
- CSS grid and visual effects
- Keyboard support
